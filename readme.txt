== Description ==

YAWP Utils - Yet Another WordPress Plugin - Adds 2 features to your WordPress install, Set Email Address and Search/Replace. Find them under 'Settings' after the plugin is activated. 

* With Set Email Address choose the email address and email name to be used when an email is sent from the WordPress site, instead of the generic wordpress@site email. You can also send a simple test email to not only test the newly chosen email identity but also to verify that the site's email transmission is functioning properly.

* With Search/Replace choose any number of terms and replace with other terms or nothing. This feature does not permanently alter the content of the site, instead it intercepts and changes the content before they are sent to browsers.

Both utils can be independently activated or deactivated by clicking a checkbox. They are also very safe, have minimal interaction with the database, and do not alter any underlying or original content other than saving or reading their own settings.

== Installation ==

Normal plugin install process. After activating it, look for the utils under the 'Settings' menu to configure them.
